### Interaction Page

In the instrument interactive page, user has the ability to zoom, rotate, split and select components, and even play some music.

- The zoom function can be zoomed in or out through the buttons on the bottom right of the screen or through the mouse wheel.
- The rotation function is turned on by the button, and once turned on, the model will rotate within a certain angle.
- At the same time, the model provides a basic split function, which is done via the button at the bottom right. Before and after splitting, the user both can zoom in and view by clicking a certain part, and double-click it to enter the interactive interface of a single part.
- Click background music buttons to get a vivid knowledge about this instrument.
